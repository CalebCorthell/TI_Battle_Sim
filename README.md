# TI_Battle_Sim
I created this project to simulate the combat of Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium.
The main goal of this program is to create win/loss percentages based on a combat's initial conditions.
To implement this process, I created methods that ask the user for initial fight conditions as well as methods for
taking a receiving damage. 
The end result is a highly accurate simulation that gives accurate statistics about win/loss/draw rate, as well as an
ouput detailing how combat will play out.
